Rai's and Luo's Pacman Game

Compiling and Run Instructions
1. Compile and run Game.java from the master branch.
2. Once you run Game.java, the game will start. 

Usage Instructions

1.Use the arrow keys to control Pacman. The up arrow key makes Pacman go up, the down arrow key makes Pacman go down, the right arrow key makes Pacman go right, and the left arrow key makes Pacman go left.
2. Run Pacman into a ghost, and Pacman will lose one life. Pacman has a total of 3 lives. Once you lose all three lives, you lose the game. Then, you will be given the option of restarting the game or exiting.
3. If Pacman eats one of the four power pellets(the oversized pac-dots that are located in each corner of the maze), the ghosts will go into "Blue-Mode" for seven seconds which means that they will be eaten by Pacman if they run into each other.  
4. Have Pacman eat all of the dots (without touching a ghost) in order to win the game.
5.  If you win the game, you will be given an option to exit the game or restart the game.

Development Log

Jan 7:  We were able to set up the grid layout for the project and put Pacman onto the grid, scaling the image to an appropriate size for the grid.  We also set the color of the background to black.
          
Jan 8: Major issue in which we didn't know how to make Pacman move.  However, we were able to add the ghosts onto the grid.
  
Jan 9:
